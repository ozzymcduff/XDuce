<H1>XDuce: A Typed XML Processing Language</H1>


<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>XDuce ("transduce") is a typed programming language that is
specifically designed for processing XML data. One can read an XML
document as an XDuce value, extract information from it or convert it
to another format, and write out the result value as an XML
document. Since XDuce is statically typed, XDuce programs never crash
at run time and the resulting XML documents always conform specified
types. 
</P>
<P>XDuce has several notable features. 
<OL TYPE="1">
	<LI>Regular expression types, which are similar
in spirit to Document Type Definitions (DTD).
	<LI>A powerful notion of subtyping. (It allows
any subtyping relation that you may expect from your intuition on
inclusion relation of regular expressions.) It not only gives
substantial flexibility in programming, but also is useful for schema
evolution or integration.
	<LI>Regular expression pattern matching. In
addition to ML-like patterns, we can match values against regular
expression types.
        <li>Attribute types in the style of RELAX NG.  We can mix both
attribute constraints and element constraints in the same regular expression notation.
        <li>Regular expression filters, an extension of pattern matching
where we can form a regular expression over pattern clauses.
        <li>Parametric polymorphism.
</OL>
</P>


<H2>Implementation Status</H2>

<P>This implementation is a part of our ongoing research.  The
language design has not been finished, and some algorithmic issues in
type checking and the run-time system still remain.  This language
system is likely to be drastically changed in near future.  So please
do not depend on this software.  On the other hand, any comments and
suggestions are welcome! </P>


<H2>System Requirements</H2>

<P>XDuce system is solely written in <A HREF="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html">the O'Caml language</A>.  In
principle, XDuce should run on any platform that O'Caml supports.  In
particular, we have checked that XDuce works on the following.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>SunOS 5.7
	<LI>Intel Linux
	<LI>LinuxPPC
	<LI>IRIX
        <li>Mac OS X
</UL>

<P>We have not yet tested compilation on Windows.  However, since
recent versions of O'Caml and the libraries that XDuce depends on
support Windoes with Cygwin, XDuce should work on this platform in
principle.  
</P>

<H2>Building XDuce</H2>
<OL TYPE="1">
	<LI>Make sure that GNU make or its equivalent is installed.
	<LI>Install <A HREF="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html">
	O'Caml</A> (newer than 3.04; older ones may not work) if not
yet installed.
	<LI>Install the <A HREF="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/findlib/">findlib</A> tool (newer than 0.6.2).
	<LI>Install the following libraries in this order.
	<OL TYPE="a">
		<LI><A HREF="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/netstring">netstring</A> (newer than 0.10.1)
		<LI><A HREF="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/pxp">PXP</A> (newer than 1.1.3)
	</OL>
	<P>Note: You have to build each library by typing "make opt"
in order to build xduce by the native O'Caml compiler (type "make
all" if you want to compile the bytecode version of xduce).  </P>
	<P>Note: You can also install all the above software by using
<a href="http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/">GODI</a> (package manager for O'Caml libraries).  In this case, replace netstring with ocamlnet.</P>

	<LI>Compile XDuce as follows.
	<OL TYPE="a">
		<LI>tar xvfz xduce-xxx.tar.gz
		(where xxx is the version number of XDuce you downloaded).
		<LI>cd xduce-xxx
		<LI>make
	</OL>

<P>It will produce an executable file named xduce.opt in the
xduce-xxx directory.  </P>

<P>On platforms where native O'Caml compiler is not supported, still
bytecode version may work.  For this compilation, type:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>make debug</BLOCKQUOTE>
This will yield an executable file xduce.  The usage is the same.
</P>

	<LI>At the moment, we do not provide any automatic
installation mechanism.  You may move the executable wherever you
want.  Note, however, it directly refers to the xduce-xxx/lib
directory.  Make sure that this directory is accessible when you use
the executable.  Or, if you need to move the lib directory, then
specify the new location by -path option:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	xduce.opt -path &lt;new-location&gt; ...
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

 </OL>

<H2>Usage</H2>

<P>type
<BLOCKQUOTE>xduce.opt &lt;XDuce program file&gt;</BLOCKQUOTE>
to run a XDuce program.  Type
<BLOCKQUOTE>xduce.opt -help</BLOCKQUOTE>
to see options.
</P>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<P>There is no user's manual since the language design is not yet
settled.  The programs found in "examples" directory would be useful
for understanding the language.  Also, the files in "lib" directory
(such as "pervasive.q" and "xml.q") would be worth seeing.  </P>
